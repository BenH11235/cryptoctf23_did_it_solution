# CryptoCTF23 -- DiD it -- Solution

This is a solution of the "DiD it" challenge from CryptoCTF23. The solution is less focused on the implementation details and more on an investigation of the surprisingly interesting mathematical game the challenge is built on top of; as it turns out, a complete analysis of the game in the general case requires understanding of function branches, graph chromatic numbers and NP-completeness.

In the understandable case you don't want to build the pdf from source, head on to the 'releases' page.
